     * Create, change, update, or delete authoritative DNS information on all Amazon
Route 53 servers. Send a POST request to: 

 /2013-04-01/hostedzone/Amazon Route 53 hosted Zone ID/rrset resource. 

The request body must include a document with a ChangeResourceRecordSetsRequest 
element. The request body contains a list of change items, known as a change
batch. Change batches are considered transactional changes. When using the
Amazon Route 53 API to change resource record sets, Amazon Route 53 either makes
all or none of the changes in a change batch request. This ensures that Amazon
Route 53 never partially implements the intended changes to the resource record
sets in a hosted zone. 

For example, a change batch request that deletes the CNAMErecord for
www.example.com and creates an alias resource record set for www.example.com.
Amazon Route 53 deletes the first resource record set and creates the second
resource record set in a single operation. If either the DELETE or the CREATE 
action fails, then both changes (plus any other changes in the batch) fail, and
the original CNAME record continues to exist.

Due to the nature of transactional changes, you cannot delete the same resource
record set more than once in a single change batch. If you attempt to delete the
same change batch more than once, Amazon Route 53 returns an InvalidChangeBatch 
error.

To create resource record sets for complex routing configurations, use either
the traffic flow visual editor in the Amazon Route 53 console or the API actions
for traffic policies and traffic policy instances. Save the configuration as a
traffic policy, then associate the traffic policy with one or more domain names
(such as example.com) or subdomain names (such as www.example.com), in the same
hosted zone or in multiple hosted zones. You can roll back the updates if the
new configuration isn&#x27;t performing as expected. For more information, see Using
Traffic Flow to Route DNS Traffic
[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/traffic-flow.html] in
the Amazon Route 53 API Reference or Actions on Traffic Policies and Traffic
Policy Instances
[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/actions-on-polices] in
this guide.

Use ChangeResourceRecordsSetsRequest to perform the following actions:

 &amp;#42;   CREATE:Creates a resource record set that has the specified values.
   
   
 &amp;#42;   DELETE: Deletes an existing resource record set that has the specified
   values for Name, Type, Set Identifier (for code latency, weighted,
   geolocation, and failover resource record sets), and TTL (except alias
   resource record sets, for which the TTL is determined by the AWS resource
   you&#x27;re routing queries to).
   
   
 &amp;#42;   UPSERT: If a resource record set does not already exist, AWS creates it. If
   a resource set does exist, Amazon Route 53 updates it with the values in the
   request. Amazon Route 53 can update an existing resource record set only when
   all of the following values match: Name, Type, and Set Identifier (for
   weighted, latency, geolocation, and failover resource record sets).
   
   

In response to a ChangeResourceRecordSets request, the DNS data is changed on
all Amazon Route 53 DNS servers. Initially, the status of a change is PENDING,
meaning the change has not yet propagated to all the authoritative Amazon Route
53 DNS servers. When the change is propagated to all hosts, the change returns a
status of INSYNC.

After sending a change request, confirm your change has propagated to all Amazon
Route 53 DNS servers. Changes generally propagate to all Amazon Route 53 name
servers in a few minutes. In rare circumstances, propagation can take up to 30
minutes. For more information, see GetChange.

Note the following limitations on a ChangeResourceRecordSets request:

 &amp;#42;   A request cannot contain more than 100 Change elements.
   
   
 &amp;#42;   A request cannot contain more than 1000 ResourceRecord elements.
   
   
 &amp;#42;  The sum of the number of characters (including spaces) in all Value elements
   in a request cannot exceed 32,000 characters.
   
   
 &amp;#42;  If the value of the Action element in a ChangeResourceRecordSets request is 
   UPSERT and the resource record set already exists, Amazon Route 53
   automatically performs a DELETE request and a CREATE request. When Amazon
   Route 53 calculates the number of characters in the Value elements of a
   change batch request, it adds the number of characters in the Value element
   of the resource record set being deleted and the number of characters in the
   Value element of the resource record set being created.
   
   
 &amp;#42;  The same resource cannot be deleted more than once in a single batch.
   
   

If the value of the Action element in a ChangeResourceRecordSets request is 
UPSERT and the resource record set already exists, Amazon Route 53 automatically
performs a DELETE request and a CREATE request. When Amazon Route 53 calculates
the number of characters in the Value elements of a change batch request, it
adds the number of characters in the Value element of the resource record set
being deleted and the number of characters in the Value element of the resource
record set being created.

For more information on transactional changes, see ChangeResourceRecordSets.

     * Creates a new health check.

To create a new health check, send a POST request to the /2013-04-01/healthcheck 
resource. The request body must include an XML document with a 
CreateHealthCheckRequest element. The response returns the 
CreateHealthCheckResponse element, containing the health check ID specified when
adding health check to a resource record set. For information about adding
health checks to resource record sets, see ResourceRecordSet$HealthCheckId in 
ChangeResourceRecordSets. 

If you are registering Amazon EC2 instances with an Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)
load balancer, do not create Amazon Route 53 health checks for the Amazon EC2
instances. When you register an Amazon EC2 instance with a load balancer, you
configure settings for an ELB health check, which performs a similar function to
an Amazon Route 53 health check.

You can associate health checks with failover resource record sets in a private
hosted zone. Note the following:

 &amp;#42;  Amazon Route 53 health checkers are outside the VPC. To check the health of
   an endpoint within a VPC by IP address, you must assign a public IP address
   to the instance in the VPC.
   
   
 &amp;#42;  You can configure a health checker to check the health of an external
   resource that the instance relies on, such as a database server.
   
   
 &amp;#42;  You can create a CloudWatch metric, associate an alarm with the metric, and
   then create a health check that is based on the state of the alarm. For
   example, you might create a CloudWatch metric that checks the status of the
   Amazon EC2 StatusCheckFailed metric, add an alarm to the metric, and then
   create a health check that is based on the state of the alarm. For
   information about creating CloudWatch metrics and alarms by using the
   CloudWatch console, see the Amazon CloudWatch Developer Guide
   [http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/WhatIsCloudWatch.html]

    /**
     * Creates a new public hosted zone, used to specify how the Domain Name System

Public hosted zones cannot be converted to a private hosted zone or vice versa.
Instead, create a new hosted zone with the same name and create new resource
record sets.

Send a POST request to the /Amazon Route 53 API version/hostedzone resource. The
request body must include an XML document with a CreateHostedZoneRequest 
element. The response returns the CreateHostedZoneResponse element containing
metadata about the hosted zone.

Fore more information about charges for hosted zones, see AmazonAmazon Route 53
Pricing [http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/pricing/].

Note the following:

 &amp;#42;  You cannot create a hosted zone for a top-level domain (TLD).
   
   
 &amp;#42;  Amazon Route 53 automatically creates a default SOA record and four NS
   records for the zone. For more information about SOA and NS records, see NS
   and SOA Records that Amazon Route 53 Creates for a Hosted Zone
   [http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/SOA-NSrecords.html] 
   in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.
   
   
 &amp;#42;  If your domain is registered with a registrar other than Amazon Route 53,
   you must update the name servers with your registrar to make Amazon Route 53
   your DNS service. For more information, see Configuring Amazon Route 53 as
   your DNS Service
   [http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/creating-migrating.html] 
   in the Amazon Route 53 Developer&#x27;s Guide.
   
   

After creating a zone, its initial status is PENDING. This means that it is not
yet available on all DNS servers. The status of the zone changes to INSYNC when
the NS and SOA records are available on all Amazon Route 53 DNS servers. 

When trying to create a hosted zone using a reusable delegation set, specify an
optional DelegationSetId, and Amazon Route 53 would assign those 4 NS records
for the zone, instead of alloting a new one.

 ListHostedZonesByName sorts hosted zones by name with the labels reversed. For
example:

Note the trailing dot, which can change the sort order in some circumstances.

If the domain name includes escape characters or Punycode, ListHostedZonesByName 
alphabetizes the domain name using the escaped or Punycoded value, which is the
format that Amazon Route 53 saves in its database. For example, to create a
hosted zone for example.com, specify ex\344mple.com for the domain name. 
ListHostedZonesByName alphabetizes it as:

 &amp;#42;   com.ex\344mple. 
   
   

The labels are reversed and alphabetized using the escaped value. For more

names, see DNS Domain Name Format

 3.  Amazon Route 53 deletes the old group of resource record sets that are

&amp;#42;   Another Amazon Route 53 resource record set: Specify the value of the Name 
 element for a resource record set in the current hosted zone. **/
      DNSName: DNSName;
      /** Applies only to alias, weighted alias, latency alias, and failover alias record
sets: If you set the value of EvaluateTargetHealth to true for the resource
record set or sets in an alias, weighted alias, latency alias, or failover alias
resource record set, and if you specify a value for HealthCheck$Id for every
resource record set that is referenced by these alias resource record sets, the
alias resource record sets inherit the health of the referenced resource record
sets.

In this configuration, when Amazon Route 53 receives a DNS query for an alias
resource record set:

&amp;#42;  Amazon Route 53 looks at the resource record sets that are referenced by the
 alias resource record sets to determine which health checks they&#x27;re using.
 
 
&amp;#42;  Amazon Route 53 checks the current status of each health check. (Amazon
 Route 53 periodically checks the health of the endpoint that is specified in
 a health check; it doesn&#x27;t perform the health check when the DNS query
 arrives.)
 
 
&amp;#42;  Based on the status of the health checks, Amazon Route 53 determines which
 resource record sets are healthy. Unhealthy resource record sets are
 immediately removed from consideration. In addition, if all of the resource
 record sets that are referenced by an alias resource record set are
 unhealthy, that alias resource record set also is immediately removed from
 consideration.
 
 
&amp;#42;  Based on the configuration of the alias resource record sets (weighted alias
 or latency alias, for example) and the configuration of the resource record
 sets that they reference, Amazon Route 53 chooses a resource record set from
 the healthy resource record sets, and responds to the query.
 
 

Note the following:

&amp;#42;  You cannot set EvaluateTargetHealth to true when the alias target is a
 CloudFront distribution.
 
 
&amp;#42;  If the AWS resource that you specify in AliasTarget is a resource record set
 or a group of resource record sets (for example, a group of weighted resource
 record sets), but it is not another alias resource record set, we recommend
 that you associate a health check with all of the resource record sets in the
 alias target.For more information, see What Happens When You Omit Health
 Checks?
 [http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-complex-configs.html#dns-failover-complex-configs-hc-omitting] 
 in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.
 
 
&amp;#42;  If you specify an Elastic Beanstalk environment in HostedZoneId and DNSName,
 and if the environment contains an ELB load balancer, Elastic Load Balancing
 routes queries only to the healthy Amazon EC2 instances that are registered
 with the load balancer. (An environment automatically contains an ELB load
 balancer if it includes more than one Amazon EC2 instance.) If you set 
 EvaluateTargetHealth to true and either no Amazon EC2 instances are healthy
 or the load balancer itself is unhealthy, Amazon Route 53 routes queries to
 other available resources that are healthy, if any.
 
 If the environment contains a single Amazon EC2 instance, there are no
 special requirements.
 
 
&amp;#42;  If you specify an ELB load balancer in AliasTarget , Elastic Load Balancing
 routes queries only to the healthy Amazon EC2 instances that are registered
 with the load balancer. If no Amazon EC2 instances are healthy or if the load
 balancer itself is unhealthy, and if EvaluateTargetHealth is true for the
 corresponding alias resource record set, Amazon Route 53 routes queries to
 other resources. When you create a load balancer, you configure settings for
 Elastic Load Balancing health checks; they&#x27;re not Amazon Route 53 health
 checks, but they perform a similar function. Do not create Amazon Route 53
 health checks for the Amazon EC2 instances that you register with an ELB load
 balancer.
 
 For more information, see How Health Checks Work in More Complex Amazon Route
 53 Configurations
 [http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-complex-configs.html] 
 in the Amazon Route 53 Developers Guide.
 
 
&amp;#42;  We recommend that you set EvaluateTargetHealth to true only when you have
 enough idle capacity to handle the failure of one or more endpoints.

Failover

      /** If you want Amazon Route 53 to return this resource record set in response to a
DNS query only when a health check is passing, include the HealthCheckId element
and specify the ID of the applicable health check.

Amazon Route 53 determines whether a resource record set is healthy by
periodically sending a request to the endpoint that is specified in the health
check. If that endpoint returns an HTTP status code of 2xx or 3xx, the endpoint
is healthy. If the endpoint returns an HTTP status code of 400 or greater, or if
the endpoint doesn&#x27;t respond for a certain amount of time, Amazon Route 53
considers the endpoint unhealthy and also considers the resource record set
unhealthy.

The HealthCheckId element is only useful when Amazon Route 53 is choosing
between two or more resource record sets to respond to a DNS query, and you want
Amazon Route 53 to base the choice in part on the status of a health check.
Configuring health checks only makes sense in the following configurations:

&amp;#42;  You&#x27;re checking the health of the resource record sets in a weighted,
 latency, geolocation, or failover resource record set, and you specify health
 check IDs for all of the resource record sets. If the health check for one
 resource record set specifies an endpoint that is not healthy, Amazon Route
 53 stops responding to queries using the value for that resource record set.
 
 
&amp;#42;  You set EvaluateTargetHealth to true for the resource record sets in an
 alias, weighted alias, latency alias, geolocation alias, or failover alias
 resource record set, and you specify health check IDs for all of the resource
 record sets that are referenced by the alias resource record sets. For more
 information about this configuration, see EvaluateTargetHealth.
 
 Amazon Route 53 doesn&#x27;t check the health of the endpoint specified in the
 resource record set, for example, the endpoint specified by the IP address in
 the Value element. When you add a HealthCheckId element to a resource record
 set, Amazon Route 53 checks the health of the endpoint that you specified in
 the health check.
 
 

For geolocation resource record sets, if an endpoint is unhealthy, Amazon Route
53 looks for a resource record set for the larger, associated geographic region.
For example, suppose you have resource record sets for a state in the United
States, for the United States, for North America, and for all locations. If the
endpoint for the state resource record set is unhealthy, Amazon Route 53 checks
the resource record sets for the United States, for North America, and for all
locations (a resource record set for which the value of CountryCode is &amp;#42;), in
that order, until it finds a resource record set for which the endpoint is
healthy.

If your health checks specify the endpoint only by domain name, we recommend
that you create a separate health check for each endpoint. For example, create a
health check for each HTTP server that is serving content for www.example.com.
For the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName, specify the domain name of the server
(such as us-east-1-www.example.com), not the name of the resource record sets
(example.com).

In this configuration, if you create a health check for which the value of 
FullyQualifiedDomainName matches the name of the resource record sets and then
associate the health check with those resource record sets, health check results
will be unpredictable. **/

Using an IP address that DNS returns, Amazon Route 53 then checks the health of
the endpoint.

If the endpoint is an Amazon EC2 instance, we recommend that you create an
Elastic IP address, associate it with your Amazon EC2 instance, and specify the
Elastic IP address for IPAddress. This ensures that the IP address of your

&amp;#42;   CLOUDWATCH_METRIC: The health check is associated with a CloudWatch alarm.
 If the state of the alarm is OK, the health check is considered healthy. If
 the state is ALARM, the health check is considered unhealthy. If CloudWatch
 doesn&#x27;t have sufficient data to determine whether the state is OK or ALARM,
 the health check status depends on the setting for 
 InsufficientDataHealthStatus: Healthy, Unhealthy, or LastKnownStatus. 
 
 
&amp;#42;   CALCULATED: For health checks that monitor the status of other health
 checks, Amazon Route 53 adds up the number of health checks that Amazon Route
 53 health checkers consider to be healthy and compares that number with the
 value of HealthThreshold. 
 
 

For more information about how Amazon Route 53 determines whether an endpoint is
healthy, see the introduction to this topic. **/

      /** The path, if any, that you want Amazon Route 53 to request when performing
health checks. The path can be any value for which your endpoint will return an

file /docs/route53-health-check.html. **/
      ResourcePath?: ResourcePath;
      /** Amazon Route 53 behavior depends on whether you specify a value for IPAddress.

If you specify IPAddress:

The value that you want Amazon Route 53 to pass in the Host header in all health
checks except TCP health checks. This is typically the fully qualified DNS name
of the website that you are attempting to health check. When Amazon Route 53
checks the health of an endpoint, here is how it constructs the Host header:

&amp;#42;  If you specify a value of 80 for Port and HTTP or HTTP_STR_MATCH for Type,
 Amazon Route 53 passes the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName to the endpoint
 in the Host header. 
 
 
&amp;#42;  If you specify a value of 443 for Port and HTTPS or HTTPS_STR_MATCH for Type,
 Amazon Route 53 passes the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName to the endpoint
 in the Host header.
 
 
&amp;#42;  If you specify another value for Port and any value except TCP for Type,
 Amazon Route 53 passes FullyQualifiedDomainName:Port to the endpoint in the 
 Host header.
 
 

If you don&#x27;t specify a value for FullyQualifiedDomainName, Amazon Route 53
substitutes the value of IPAddress in the Host header in each of the preceding
cases.

If you don&#x27;t specify IPAddress:

If you don&#x27;t specify a value for IPAddress, Amazon Route 53 sends a DNS request
to the domain that you specify in FullyQualifiedDomainName at the interval you
specify in RequestInterval. Using an IP address that DNS returns, Amazon Route
53 then checks the health of the endpoint.

If you want to check the health of weighted, latency, or failover resource
record sets and you choose to specify the endpoint only by 
FullyQualifiedDomainName, we recommend that you create a separate health check
for each endpoint. For example, create a health check for each HTTP server that
is serving content for www.example.com. For the value of 
FullyQualifiedDomainName, specify the domain name of the server (such as
us-east-1-www.example.com), not the name of the resource record sets
(www.example.com).

In this configuration, if you create a health check for which the value of 
FullyQualifiedDomainName matches the name of the resource record sets and you
then associate the health check with those resource record sets, health check
results will be unpredictable.

In addition, if the value that you specify for Type is HTTP, HTTPS, 
HTTP_STR_MATCH, or HTTPS_STR_MATCH, Amazon Route 53 passes the value of 
FullyQualifiedDomainName in the Host header, as it does when you specify a value
for IPAddress. If the value of Type is TCP, Amazon Route 53 doesn&#x27;t pass a Host 
header. **/

SPF records were formerly used to verify the identity of the sender of email
messages. However, we no longer recommend that you create resource record sets
for which the value of Type is SPF. RFC 7208, Sender Policy Framework (SPF) for
Authorizing Use of Domains in Email, Version 1, has been updated to say,
&quot;...[I]ts existence and mechanism defined in [RFC4408] have led to some
interoperability issues. Accordingly, its use is no longer appropriate for SPF
version 1; implementations are not to use it.&quot; In RFC 7208, see section 14.1, 
The SPF DNS Record Type [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7208#section-14.1].

sets that have the same combination of DNS name and type. Amazon Route 53 then
responds to queries based on the ratio of a resource&#x27;s weight to the total. Note
the following:

&amp;#42;  You must specify a value for the Weight element for every weighted resource
 record set.
 
 
&amp;#42;  You can only specify one ResourceRecord per weighted resource record set.
 
 
&amp;#42;  You cannot create latency, failover, or geolocation resource record sets

&amp;#42;  You can create a maximum of 100 weighted resource record sets that have the

 The effect of setting Weight to 0 is different when you associate health
 checks with weighted resource record sets. For more information, see Options

the record type.

Creating latency and latency alias resource record sets in private hosted zones

web server with an IP address of 192.0.2.111, create a resource record set with
a Type of A and a ContinentCode of AF.

Creating geolocation and geolocation alias resource record sets in private
hosted zones is not supported.

If you create separate resource record sets for overlapping geographic regions
(for example, one resource record set for a continent and one for a country on
the same continent), priority goes to the smallest geographic region. This
allows you to route most queries for a continent to one resource and to route
queries for a country on that continent to a different resource.

You cannot create two geolocation resource record sets that specify the same
geographic location.

The value &amp;#42; in the CountryCode element matches all geographic locations that
aren&#x27;t specified in other geolocation resource record sets that have the same
values for the Name and Type elements.

Geolocation works by mapping IP addresses to locations. However, some IP
addresses aren&#x27;t mapped to geographic locations, so even if you create
geolocation resource record sets that cover all seven continents, Amazon Route
53 will receive some DNS queries from locations that it can&#x27;t identify. We
recommend that you create a resource record set for which the value of 
CountryCode is &amp;#42;, which handles both queries that come from locations for which
you haven&#x27;t created geolocation resource record sets and queries from IP
addresses that aren&#x27;t mapped to a location. If you don&#x27;t create a &amp;#42; resource
record set, Amazon Route 53 returns a &quot;no answer&quot; response for queries from
those locations.

You cannot create non-geolocation resource record sets that have the same values
for the Name and Type elements as geolocation resource record sets. **/

      /** Failover resource record sets only: To configure failover, you add the Failover 
element to two resource record sets. For one resource record set, you specify 
PRIMARY as the value for Failover; for the other resource record set, you
specify SECONDARY. In addition, you include the HealthCheckId element and
specify the health check that you want Amazon Route 53 to perform for each
resource record set.

Except where noted, the following failover behaviors assume that you have
included the HealthCheckId element in both resource record sets:

&amp;#42;  When the primary resource record set is healthy, Amazon Route 53 responds to
 DNS queries with the applicable value from the primary resource record set
 regardless of the health of the secondary resource record set.
 
 
&amp;#42;  When the primary resource record set is unhealthy and the secondary resource
 record set is healthy, Amazon Route 53 responds to DNS queries with the
 applicable value from the secondary resource record set.
 
 
&amp;#42;  When the secondary resource record set is unhealthy, Amazon Route 53
 responds to DNS queries with the applicable value from the primary resource
 record set regardless of the health of the primary resource record set.
 
 
&amp;#42;  If you omit the HealthCheckId element for the secondary resource record set,
 and if the primary resource record set is unhealthy, Amazon Route 53 always
 responds to DNS queries with the applicable value from the secondary resource
 record set. This is true regardless of the health of the associated endpoint.
 
 

You cannot create non-failover resource record sets that have the same values
for the Name and Type elements as failover resource record sets.

For failover alias resource record sets, you must also include the 
EvaluateTargetHealth element and set the value to true.

      /** If you want Amazon Route 53 to return this resource record set in response to a
DNS query only when a health check is passing, include the HealthCheckId element
and specify the ID of the applicable health check.

Amazon Route 53 determines whether a resource record set is healthy based on one
of the following:

&amp;#42;  By periodically sending a request to the endpoint that is specified in the
 health check
 
 
&amp;#42;  By aggregating the status of a specified group of health checks (calculated
 health checks)
 
 
&amp;#42;  By determining the current state of a CloudWatch alarm (CloudWatch metric
 health checks)
 
 

For information about how Amazon Route 53 determines whether a health check is
healthy, see CreateHealthCheck.

The HealthCheckId element is only useful when Amazon Route 53 is choosing
between two or more resource record sets to respond to a DNS query, and you want
Amazon Route 53 to base the choice in part on the status of a health check.
Configuring health checks only makes sense in the following configurations:

&amp;#42;  You&#x27;re checking the health of the resource record sets in a weighted,
 latency, geolocation, or failover resource record set, and you specify health
 check IDs for all of the resource record sets. If the health check for one
 resource record set specifies an endpoint that is not healthy, Amazon Route
 53 stops responding to queries using the value for that resource record set.
 
 
&amp;#42;  You set EvaluateTargetHealth to true for the resource record sets in an
 alias, weighted alias, latency alias, geolocation alias, or failover alias
 resource record set, and you specify health check IDs for all of the resource
 record sets that are referenced by the alias resource record sets.
 
 

Amazon Route 53 doesn&#x27;t check the health of the endpoint specified in the
resource record set, for example, the endpoint specified by the IP address in
the Value element. When you add a HealthCheckId element to a resource record
set, Amazon Route 53 checks the health of the endpoint that you specified in the
health check. 

For geolocation resource record sets, if an endpoint is unhealthy, Amazon Route
53 looks for a resource record set for the larger, associated geographic region.
For example, suppose you have resource record sets for a state in the United
States, for the United States, for North America, and for all locations. If the
endpoint for the state resource record set is unhealthy, Amazon Route 53 checks
the resource record sets for the United States, for North America, and for all
locations (a resource record set for which the value of CountryCode is &amp;#42;), in
that order, until it finds a resource record set for which the endpoint is
healthy. 

If your health checks specify the endpoint only by domain name, we recommend
that you create a separate health check for each endpoint. For example, create a
health check for each HTTP server that is serving content for www.example.com.
For the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName, specify the domain name of the server
(such as us-east-1-www.example.com), not the name of the resource record sets
(example.com).

n this configuration, if you create a health check for which the value of 
FullyQualifiedDomainName matches the name of the resource record sets and then
associate the health check with those resource record sets, health check results
will be unpredictable.

 in the Host header.
 
 
&amp;#42;  If you specify another value for Port and any value except TCP for Type,
 Amazon Route 53 passes FullyQualifiedDomainName:Port to the endpoint in the
 Host header.
 
 

If you don&#x27;t specify a value for FullyQualifiedDomainName, Amazon Route 53
substitutes the value of IPAddress in the Host header in each of the above
cases.
