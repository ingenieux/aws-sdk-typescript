    * AWS Security Token Service The AWS Security Token Service (STS) is a web service
 that enables you to request temporary, limited-privilege credentials for AWS
 Identity and Access Management (IAM) users or for users that you authenticate
 (federated users). This guide provides descriptions of the STS API. For more
 detailed information about using this service, go to Temporary Security
 Credentials
 [http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp.html]. 
 
  As an alternative to using the API, you can use one of the AWS SDKs, which
 consist of libraries and sample code for various programming languages and
 platforms (Java, Ruby, .NET, iOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs provide a convenient
 way to create programmatic access to STS. For example, the SDKs take care of
 cryptographically signing requests, managing errors, and retrying requests
 automatically. For information about the AWS SDKs, including how to download and
 install them, see the Tools for Amazon Web Services page
 [http://aws.amazon.com/tools/]. 
 
 For information about setting up signatures and authorization through the API,
 go to Signing AWS API Requests
 [http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signing_aws_api_requests.html] in
 the AWS General Reference. For general information about the Query API, go to 
 Making Query Requests
 [http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/IAM_UsingQueryAPI.html] in 
 Using IAM. For information about using security tokens with other AWS products,
 go to AWS Services That Work with IAM
 [http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_aws-services-that-work-with-iam.html] 
 in the IAM User Guide. 
 
 If you&#x27;re new to AWS and need additional technical information about a specific
 AWS product, you can find the product&#x27;s technical documentation at 
 http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/ [http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/]. 
 
  Endpoints 
 
 The AWS Security Token Service (STS) has a default endpoint of
 https://sts.amazonaws.com that maps to the US East (N. Virginia) region.
 Additional regions are available and are activated by default. For more
 information, see Activating and Deactivating AWS STS in an AWS Region
 [http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_enable-regions.html] 
 in the IAM User Guide.
 
 For information about STS endpoints, see Regions and Endpoints
 [http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#sts_region] in the AWS
 General Reference.
 
  Recording API requests 
 
 STS supports AWS CloudTrail, which is a service that records AWS calls for your
 AWS account and delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. By using information
 collected by CloudTrail, you can determine what requests were successfully made
 to STS, who made the request, when it was made, and so on. To learn more about
 CloudTrail, including how to turn it on and find your log files, see the AWS
 CloudTrail User Guide
 [http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/what_is_cloud_trail_top_level.html]

    /**
     * Returns a set of temporary security credentials (consisting of an access key ID,
a secret access key, and a security token) that you can use to access AWS
resources that you might not normally have access to. Typically, you use 
AssumeRole for cross-account access or federation. For a comparison of 
AssumeRole with the other APIs that produce temporary credentials, see 
Requesting Temporary Security Credentials
[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html] 
and Comparing the AWS STS APIs
[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#stsapi_comparison] 
in the IAM User Guide.

 Important: You cannot call AssumeRole by using AWS root account credentials;
access is denied. You must use credentials for an IAM user or an IAM role to
call AssumeRole. 

For cross-account access, imagine that you own multiple accounts and need to
access resources in each account. You could create long-term credentials in each
account to access those resources. However, managing all those credentials and
remembering which one can access which account can be time consuming. Instead,
you can create one set of long-term credentials in one account and then use
temporary security credentials to access all the other accounts by assuming
roles in those accounts. For more information about roles, see IAM Roles
(Delegation and Federation)
[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/roles-toplevel.html] in the IAM
User Guide. 

For federation, you can, for example, grant single sign-on access to the AWS
Management Console. If you already have an identity and authentication system in
your corporate network, you don&#x27;t have to recreate user identities in AWS in
order to grant those user identities access to AWS. Instead, after a user has
been authenticated, you call AssumeRole (and specify the role with the
appropriate permissions) to get temporary security credentials for that user.
With those temporary security credentials, you construct a sign-in URL that
users can use to access the console. For more information, see Common Scenarios
for Temporary Credentials
[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp.html#sts-introduction] 
in the IAM User Guide.

The temporary security credentials are valid for the duration that you specified
when calling AssumeRole, which can be from 900 seconds (15 minutes) to a maximum
of 3600 seconds (1 hour). The default is 1 hour. 

The temporary security credentials created by AssumeRole can be used to make API
calls to any AWS service with the following exception: you cannot call the STS
service&#x27;s GetFederationToken or GetSessionToken APIs.

Optionally, you can pass an IAM access policy to this operation. If you choose
not to pass a policy, the temporary security credentials that are returned by
the operation have the permissions that are defined in the access policy of the
role that is being assumed. If you pass a policy to this operation, the
temporary security credentials that are returned by the operation have the
permissions that are allowed by both the access policy of the role that is being
assumed, and the policy that you pass. This gives you a way to further restrict
the permissions for the resulting temporary security credentials. You cannot use
the passed policy to grant permissions that are in excess of those allowed by
the access policy of the role that is being assumed. For more information, see 
Permissions for AssumeRole, AssumeRoleWithSAML, and AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity
[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_control-access_assumerole.html] 
in the IAM User Guide.

To assume a role, your AWS account must be trusted by the role. The trust
relationship is defined in the role&#x27;s trust policy when the role is created.
That trust policy states which accounts are allowed to delegate access to this
account&#x27;s role.

The user who wants to access the role must also have permissions delegated from
the role&#x27;s administrator. If the user is in a different account than the role,
then the user&#x27;s administrator must attach a policy that allows the user to call
AssumeRole on the ARN of the role in the other account. If the user is in the
same account as the role, then you can either attach a policy to the user
(identical to the previous different account user), or you can add the user as a
principal directly in the role&#x27;s trust policy

 Using MFA with AssumeRole 

You can optionally include multi-factor authentication (MFA) information when
you call AssumeRole. This is useful for cross-account scenarios in which you
want to make sure that the user who is assuming the role has been authenticated
using an AWS MFA device. In that scenario, the trust policy of the role being
assumed includes a condition that tests for MFA authentication; if the caller
does not include valid MFA information, the request to assume the role is
denied. The condition in a trust policy that tests for MFA authentication might
look like the following example.

 &quot;Condition&quot;: {&quot;Bool&quot;: {&quot;aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent&quot;: true}} 

For more information, see Configuring MFA-Protected API Access
[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/MFAProtectedAPI.html] in the 
IAM User Guide guide.

To use MFA with AssumeRole, you pass values for the SerialNumber and TokenCode 
parameters. The SerialNumber value identifies the user&#x27;s hardware or virtual MFA
device. The TokenCode is the time-based one-time password (TOTP) that the MFA
devices produces.

    /**
     * Returns a set of temporary security credentials for users who have been
authenticated via a SAML authentication response. This operation provides a
mechanism for tying an enterprise identity store or directory to role-based AWS
access without user-specific credentials or configuration. For a comparison of 
AssumeRoleWithSAML with the other APIs that produce temporary credentials, see 
Requesting Temporary Security Credentials
[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html] 
and Comparing the AWS STS APIs
[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#stsapi_comparison] 
in the IAM User Guide.

The temporary security credentials returned by this operation consist of an
access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token. Applications can use
these temporary security credentials to sign calls to AWS services.

The temporary security credentials are valid for the duration that you specified
when calling AssumeRole, or until the time specified in the SAML authentication
response&#x27;s SessionNotOnOrAfter value, whichever is shorter. The duration can be
from 900 seconds (15 minutes) to a maximum of 3600 seconds (1 hour). The default
is 1 hour.

The temporary security credentials created by AssumeRoleWithSAML can be used to
make API calls to any AWS service with the following exception: you cannot call
the STS service&#x27;s GetFederationToken or GetSessionToken APIs.

Optionally, you can pass an IAM access policy to this operation. If you choose
not to pass a policy, the temporary security credentials that are returned by
the operation have the permissions that are defined in the access policy of the
role that is being assumed. If you pass a policy to this operation, the
temporary security credentials that are returned by the operation have the
permissions that are allowed by the intersection of both the access policy of
the role that is being assumed, and the policy that you pass. This means that
both policies must grant the permission for the action to be allowed. This gives
you a way to further restrict the permissions for the resulting temporary
security credentials. You cannot use the passed policy to grant permissions that
are in excess of those allowed by the access policy of the role that is being
assumed. For more information, see Permissions for AssumeRole,
AssumeRoleWithSAML, and AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity
[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_control-access_assumerole.html] 
in the IAM User Guide.

Before your application can call AssumeRoleWithSAML, you must configure your
SAML identity provider (IdP) to issue the claims required by AWS. Additionally,
you must use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to create a SAML provider
entity in your AWS account that represents your identity provider, and create an
IAM role that specifies this SAML provider in its trust policy. 

Calling AssumeRoleWithSAML does not require the use of AWS security credentials.
The identity of the caller is validated by using keys in the metadata document
that is uploaded for the SAML provider entity for your identity provider. 

Calling AssumeRoleWithSAML can result in an entry in your AWS CloudTrail logs.
The entry includes the value in the NameID element of the SAML assertion. We
recommend that you use a NameIDType that is not associated with any personally
identifiable information (PII). For example, you could instead use the
Persistent Identifier (urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:persistent).

     * Returns a set of temporary security credentials for users who have been
authenticated in a mobile or web application with a web identity provider, such
as Amazon Cognito, Login with Amazon, Facebook, Google, or any OpenID
Connect-compatible identity provider.

For mobile applications, we recommend that you use Amazon Cognito. You can use
Amazon Cognito with the AWS SDK for iOS [http://aws.amazon.com/sdkforios/] and
the AWS SDK for Android [http://aws.amazon.com/sdkforandroid/] to uniquely
identify a user and supply the user with a consistent identity throughout the
lifetime of an application.

To learn more about Amazon Cognito, see Amazon Cognito Overview
[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdkforandroid/developerguide/cognito-auth.html#d0e840] 
in the AWS SDK for Android Developer Guide guide and Amazon Cognito Overview
[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdkforios/developerguide/cognito-auth.html#d0e664] 
in the AWS SDK for iOS Developer Guide.

Calling AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity does not require the use of AWS security
credentials. Therefore, you can distribute an application (for example, on
mobile devices) that requests temporary security credentials without including
long-term AWS credentials in the application, and without deploying server-based
proxy services that use long-term AWS credentials. Instead, the identity of the
caller is validated by using a token from the web identity provider. For a
comparison of AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity with the other APIs that produce
temporary credentials, see Requesting Temporary Security Credentials
[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html] 
and Comparing the AWS STS APIs
[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#stsapi_comparison] 
in the IAM User Guide.

The temporary security credentials returned by this API consist of an access key
ID, a secret access key, and a security token. Applications can use these
temporary security credentials to sign calls to AWS service APIs.

The credentials are valid for the duration that you specified when calling 
AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity, which can be from 900 seconds (15 minutes) to a
maximum of 3600 seconds (1 hour). The default is 1 hour. 

The temporary security credentials created by AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity can be
used to make API calls to any AWS service with the following exception: you
cannot call the STS service&#x27;s GetFederationToken or GetSessionToken APIs.

Optionally, you can pass an IAM access policy to this operation. If you choose
not to pass a policy, the temporary security credentials that are returned by
the operation have the permissions that are defined in the access policy of the
role that is being assumed. If you pass a policy to this operation, the
temporary security credentials that are returned by the operation have the
permissions that are allowed by both the access policy of the role that is being
assumed, and the policy that you pass. This gives you a way to further restrict
the permissions for the resulting temporary security credentials. You cannot use
the passed policy to grant permissions that are in excess of those allowed by
the access policy of the role that is being assumed. For more information, see 
Permissions for AssumeRole, AssumeRoleWithSAML, and AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity
[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_control-access_assumerole.html] 
in the IAM User Guide.

Before your application can call AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity, you must have an
identity token from a supported identity provider and create a role that the
application can assume. The role that your application assumes must trust the
identity provider that is associated with the identity token. In other words,
the identity provider must be specified in the role&#x27;s trust policy. 

Calling AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity can result in an entry in your AWS CloudTrail
logs. The entry includes the Subject
[http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#Claims] of the provided
Web Identity Token. We recommend that you avoid using any personally
identifiable information (PII) in this field. For example, you could instead use
a GUID or a pairwise identifier, as suggested in the OIDC specification
[http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#SubjectIDTypes].

     * Decodes additional information about the authorization status of a request from
an encoded message returned in response to an AWS request.

For example, if a user is not authorized to perform an action that he or she has
requested, the request returns a Client.UnauthorizedOperation response (an HTTP
403 response). Some AWS actions additionally return an encoded message that can
provide details about this authorization failure. 

Only certain AWS actions return an encoded authorization message. The
documentation for an individual action indicates whether that action returns an
encoded message in addition to returning an HTTP code.

The message is encoded because the details of the authorization status can
constitute privileged information that the user who requested the action should
not see. To decode an authorization status message, a user must be granted
permissions via an IAM policy to request the DecodeAuthorizationMessage (
sts:DecodeAuthorizationMessage) action. 

The decoded message includes the following type of information:

is in a proxy application that gets temporary security credentials on behalf of
distributed applications inside a corporate network. Because you must call the 
GetFederationToken action using the long-term security credentials of an IAM

Requesting Temporary Security Credentials
[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html] 
and Comparing the AWS STS APIs
[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#stsapi_comparison] 
in the IAM User Guide.

 If you are creating a mobile-based or browser-based app that can authenticate
users using a web identity provider like Login with Amazon, Facebook, Google, or
an OpenID Connect-compatible identity provider, we recommend that you use Amazon
Cognito [http://aws.amazon.com/cognito/] or AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity. For more
information, see Federation Through a Web-based Identity Provider
[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#api_assumerolewithwebidentity]
.

The GetFederationToken action must be called by using the long-term AWS security
credentials of an IAM user. You can also call GetFederationToken using the
security credentials of an AWS root account, but we do not recommended it.
Instead, we recommend that you create an IAM user for the purpose of the proxy
application and then attach a policy to the IAM user that limits federated users
to only the actions and resources that they need access to. For more
information, see IAM Best Practices
[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html] in the IAM
User Guide. 

The temporary security credentials that are obtained by using the long-term
credentials of an IAM user are valid for the specified duration, from 900
seconds (15 minutes) up to a maximium of 129600 seconds (36 hours). The default
is 43200 seconds (12 hours). Temporary credentials that are obtained by using
AWS root account credentials have a maximum duration of 3600 seconds (1 hour).

The temporary security credentials created by GetFederationToken can be used to
make API calls to any AWS service with the following exceptions:

 &amp;#42;  You cannot use these credentials to call any IAM APIs.
   
   
 &amp;#42;  You cannot call any STS APIs.
   
   

 Permissions 

The permissions for the temporary security credentials returned by 
GetFederationToken are determined by a combination of the following: 

 &amp;#42;  The policy or policies that are attached to the IAM user whose credentials
   are used to call GetFederationToken.
   
   
 &amp;#42;  The policy that is passed as a parameter in the call.
   
   

The passed policy is attached to the temporary security credentials that result
from the GetFederationToken API call--that is, to the federated user. When the
federated user makes an AWS request, AWS evaluates the policy attached to the
federated user in combination with the policy or policies attached to the IAM
user whose credentials were used to call GetFederationToken. AWS allows the
federated user&#x27;s request only when both the federated user and the IAM user are
explicitly allowed to perform the requested action. The passed policy cannot
grant more permissions than those that are defined in the IAM user policy.

A typical use case is that the permissions of the IAM user whose credentials are
used to call GetFederationToken are designed to allow access to all the actions
and resources that any federated user will need. Then, for individual users, you
pass a policy to the operation that scopes down the permissions to a level
that&#x27;s appropriate to that individual user, using a policy that allows only a
subset of permissions that are granted to the IAM user. 

If you do not pass a policy, the resulting temporary security credentials have
no effective permissions. The only exception is when the temporary security
credentials are used to access a resource that has a resource-based policy that
specifically allows the federated user to access the resource.

GetFederationToken

credentials consist of an access key ID, a secret access key, and a security
token. Typically, you use GetSessionToken if you want to use MFA to protect
programmatic calls to specific AWS APIs like Amazon EC2 StopInstances.
MFA-enabled IAM users would need to call GetSessionToken and submit an MFA code
that is associated with their MFA device. Using the temporary security
credentials that are returned from the call, IAM users can then make
programmatic calls to APIs that require MFA authentication. If you do not supply
a correct MFA code, then the API returns an access denied error. For a

The temporary security credentials created by GetSessionToken can be used to
make API calls to any AWS service with the following exceptions:

 &amp;#42;  You cannot call any IAM APIs unless MFA authentication information is
   included in the request.
   
   
 &amp;#42;  You cannot call any STS API except AssumeRole.
   
   

We recommend that you do not call GetSessionToken with root account credentials.
Instead, follow our best practices
[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#create-iam-users] 
by creating one or more IAM users, giving them the necessary permissions, and
using IAM users for everyday interaction with AWS. 

The permissions associated with the temporary security credentials returned by 
GetSessionToken are based on the permissions associated with account or IAM user
whose credentials are used to call the action. If GetSessionToken is called
using root account credentials, the temporary credentials have root account
permissions. Similarly, if GetSessionToken is called using the credentials of an
IAM user, the temporary credentials have the same permissions as the IAM user. 

For more information about using GetSessionToken to create temporary
credentials, go to Temporary Credentials for Users in Untrusted Environments
[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#api_getsessiontoken]
