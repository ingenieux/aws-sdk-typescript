    * AWS Identity and Access Management AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a
 web service that you can use to manage users and user permissions under your AWS
 account. This guide provides descriptions of IAM actions that you can call
 programmatically. For general information about IAM, see AWS Identity and Access
 Management (IAM) [http://aws.amazon.com/iam/]. For the user guide for IAM, see 
 Using IAM [http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/]. 
 
 AWS provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various
 programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .NET, iOS, Android, etc.). The
 SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to IAM and AWS. For
 example, the SDKs take care of tasks such as cryptographically signing requests
 (see below), managing errors, and retrying requests automatically. For
 information about the AWS SDKs, including how to download and install them, see
 the Tools for Amazon Web Services [http://aws.amazon.com/tools/] page. 
 
 We recommend that you use the AWS SDKs to make programmatic API calls to IAM.
 However, you can also use the IAM Query API to make direct calls to the IAM web
 service. To learn more about the IAM Query API, see Making Query Requests
 [http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/IAM_UsingQueryAPI.html] in the 
 Using IAM guide. IAM supports GET and POST requests for all actions. That is,
 the API does not require you to use GET for some actions and POST for others.
 However, GET requests are subject to the limitation size of a URL. Therefore,
 for operations that require larger sizes, use a POST request. 
 
  Signing Requests 
 
 Requests must be signed using an access key ID and a secret access key. We
 strongly recommend that you do not use your AWS account access key ID and secret
 access key for everyday work with IAM. You can use the access key ID and secret
 access key for an IAM user or you can use the AWS Security Token Service to
 generate temporary security credentials and use those to sign requests.
 
 To sign requests, we recommend that you use Signature Version 4
 [http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html]. If you
 have an existing application that uses Signature Version 2, you do not have to
 update it to use Signature Version 4. However, some operations now require
 Signature Version 4. The documentation for operations that require version 4
 indicate this requirement.

When you create the IAM OIDC provider, you specify the URL of the OIDC identity
provider (IdP) to trust, a list of client IDs (also known as audiences) that
identify the application or applications that are allowed to authenticate using
the OIDC provider, and a list of thumbprints of the server certificate(s) that
the IdP uses. You get all of this information from the OIDC IdP that you want to

that this action creates, it is a best practice to limit access to the

using the SAML IdP to assume the role. You can create an IAM role that supports
Web-based single sign-on (SSO) to the AWS Management Console or one that
supports API access to AWS.

When you create the SAML provider resource, you upload an a SAML metadata
document that you get from your IdP and that includes the issuer&#x27;s name,
expiration information, and keys that can be used to validate the SAML
authentication response (assertions) that the IdP sends. You must generate the
metadata document using the identity management software that is used as your
organization&#x27;s IdP.

     * Deletes the specified managed policy.

Before you can delete a managed policy, you must first detach the policy from
all users, groups, and roles that it is attached to, and you must delete all of
the policy&#x27;s versions. The following steps describe the process for deleting a
managed policy:

 &amp;#42;  Detach the policy from all users, groups, and roles that the policy is
   attached to, using the DetachUserPolicy, DetachGroupPolicy, or 
   DetachRolePolicy APIs. To list all the users, groups, and roles that a policy
   is attached to, use ListEntitiesForPolicy.
   
   
 &amp;#42;  Delete all versions of the policy using DeletePolicyVersion. To list the
   policy&#x27;s versions, use ListPolicyVersions. You cannot use DeletePolicyVersion 
   to delete the version that is marked as the default version. You delete the
   policy&#x27;s default version in the next step of the process.
   
   
 &amp;#42;  Delete the policy (this automatically deletes the policy&#x27;s default version)
   using this API.

If the UserName field is not specified, the IAM user name is determined
implicitly based on the AWS access key ID used to sign the request. Because this
action works for access keys under the AWS account, you can use this action to
manage root credentials even if the AWS account has no associated users.

Because the body of a X.509 certificate can be large, you should use POST rather
than GET when calling UploadSigningCertificate. For information about setting up
signatures and authorization through the API, go to Signing AWS API Requests
[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signing_aws_api_requests.html] in
the AWS General Reference. For general information about using the Query API
with IAM, go to Making Query Requests
[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/IAM_UsingQueryAPI.html] in the 
IAM User Guide.
