    * AWS Support The AWS Support API reference is intended for programmers who need
 detailed information about the AWS Support operations and data types. This
 service enables you to manage your AWS Support cases programmatically. It uses
 HTTP methods that return results in JSON format.
 
 The AWS Support service also exposes a set of Trusted Advisor
 [https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/trustedadvisor/] features. You can
 retrieve a list of checks and their descriptions, get check results, specify
 checks to refresh, and get the refresh status of checks. 
 
 The following list describes the AWS Support case management operations: 
 
  &amp;#42;  Service names, issue categories, and available severity levels. The 
    DescribeServices and DescribeSeverityLevels operations return AWS service
    names, service codes, service categories, and problem severity levels. You
    use these values when you call the CreateCase operation. 
  &amp;#42;  Case creation, case details, and case resolution. The CreateCase, 
    DescribeCases, DescribeAttachment, and ResolveCase operations create AWS
    Support cases, retrieve information about cases, and resolve cases.
  &amp;#42;  Case communication. The DescribeCommunications, AddCommunicationToCase, and 
    AddAttachmentsToSet operations retrieve and add communications and
    attachments to AWS Support cases. 
 
 The following list describes the operations available from the AWS Support
 service for Trusted Advisor:
 
  &amp;#42;  DescribeTrustedAdvisorChecks returns the list of checks that run against
    your AWS resources.
  &amp;#42; Using the CheckId for a specific check returned by 
    DescribeTrustedAdvisorChecks, you can call DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckResult 
    to obtain the results for the check you specified.
  &amp;#42;  DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckSummaries returns summarized results for one or
    more Trusted Advisor checks.
  &amp;#42;  RefreshTrustedAdvisorCheck requests that Trusted Advisor rerun a specified
    check. 
  &amp;#42;  DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckRefreshStatuses reports the refresh status of one
    or more checks. 
 
 For authentication of requests, AWS Support uses Signature Version 4 Signing
 Process [http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html].
 
 See About the AWS Support API
 [http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/user/Welcome.html] in the AWS
 Support User Guide for information about how to use this service to create and
 manage your support cases, and how to call Trusted Advisor for results of checks
 on your resources.

An attachment set is a temporary container for attachments that are to be added

     * Creates a new case in the AWS Support Center. This operation is modeled on the
behavior of the AWS Support Center Create Case
[https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create] page. Its parameters
require you to specify the following information: 

 1.  IssueType. The type of issue for the case. You can specify either
    &quot;customer-service&quot; or &quot;technical.&quot; If you do not indicate a value, the
    default is &quot;technical.&quot; 
 2.  ServiceCode. The code for an AWS service. You obtain the ServiceCode by
    calling DescribeServices. 
 3.  CategoryCode. The category for the service defined for the ServiceCode 
    value. You also obtain the category code for a service by calling 
    DescribeServices. Each AWS service defines its own set of category codes. 
 4.  SeverityCode. A value that indicates the urgency of the case, which in turn
    determines the response time according to your service level agreement with
    AWS Support. You obtain the SeverityCode by calling DescribeSeverityLevels.
 5.  Subject. The Subject field on the AWS Support Center Create Case
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create] page.
 6.  CommunicationBody. The Description field on the AWS Support Center Create
    Case [https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create] page.
 7.  AttachmentSetId. The ID of a set of attachments that has been created by
    using AddAttachmentsToSet.
 8.  Language. The human language in which AWS Support handles the case. English
    and Japanese are currently supported.
 9.  CcEmailAddresses. The AWS Support Center CC field on the Create Case
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create] page. You can
    list email addresses to be copied on any correspondence about the case. The
    account that opens the case is already identified by passing the AWS
    Credentials in the HTTP POST method or in a method or function call from one
    of the programming languages supported by an AWS SDK
    [http://aws.amazon.com/tools/]. 

To add additional communication or attachments to an existing case, use 
AddCommunicationToCase.

A successful CreateCase request returns an AWS Support case number. Case numbers
are used by the DescribeCases operation to retrieve existing AWS Support cases.
