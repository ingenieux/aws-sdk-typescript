    * Amazon DynamoDB Amazon DynamoDB Streams provides API actions for accessing
 streams and processing stream records. To learn more about application
 development with Streams, see Capturing Table Activity with DynamoDB Streams
 [http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Streams.html] 
 in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.
 
 The following are short descriptions of each low-level DynamoDB Streams action:
 
  &amp;#42;   DescribeStream - Returns detailed information about a particular stream.
    
    
  &amp;#42;   GetRecords - Retrieves the stream records from within a shard.
    
    
  &amp;#42;   GetShardIterator - Returns information on how to retrieve the streams record
    from a shard with a given shard ID.
    
    
  &amp;#42;   ListStreams - Returns a list of all the streams associated with the current
    AWS account and endpoint.

Each shard in the stream has a SequenceNumberRange associated with it. If the 
SequenceNumberRange has a StartingSequenceNumber but no EndingSequenceNumber,
then the shard is still open (able to receive more stream records). If both 
StartingSequenceNumber and EndingSequenceNumber are present, then that shard is
closed and can no longer receive more data.

the shard that the iterator points to, GetRecords returns an empty list. Note
that it might take multiple calls to get to a portion of the shard that contains
stream records.

 GetRecords can retrieve a maximum of 1 MB of data or 1000 stream records,
whichever comes first.
