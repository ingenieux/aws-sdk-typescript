    * Amazon GameLift Service Welcome to the Amazon GameLift API Reference. Amazon GameLift is a managed
 Amazon Web Services (AWS) service for developers who need a scalable,
 server-based solution for multiplayer games. Amazon GameLift provides setup and
 deployment of game servers, and handles infrastructure scaling and session
 management.
 
 This reference describes the low-level service API for GameLift. You can call
 this API directly or use the AWS SDK [https://aws.amazon.com/tools/#sdk] for
 your preferred language. The AWS SDK includes a set of high-level GameLift
 actions multiplayer game sessions. Alternatively, you can use the AWS
 command-line interface [https://aws.amazon.com/cli/] (CLI) tool, which includes
 commands for GameLift. For administrative actions, you can also use the Amazon
 GameLift console.

 Set Up and Manage Game Servers
 
 Use these administrative actions to configure GameLift to host your game
 servers. When setting up GameLift, you&#x27;ll need to (1) configure a build for your
 game and upload build files, and (2) set up one or more fleets to host game
 sessions. Once you&#x27;ve created and activated a fleet, you can assign aliases to
 it, scale capacity, track performance and utilization, etc.

    /**
     * Creates an alias for a fleet. You can use an alias to anonymize your fleet by
referencing an alias instead of a specific fleet when you create game sessions.
Amazon GameLift supports two types of routing strategies for aliases: simple and
terminal. Use a simple alias to point to an active fleet. Use a terminal alias
to display a message to incoming traffic instead of routing players to an active
fleet. This option is useful when a game server is no longer supported but you
want to provide better messaging than a standard 404 error.

To create a fleet alias, specify an alias name, routing strategy, and optional
description. If successful, a new alias record is returned, including an alias
ID, which you can reference when creating a game session. To reassign the alias
to another fleet ID, call UpdateAlias.

    /**
     * Initializes a new build record and generates information required to upload a
game build to Amazon GameLift. Once the build record has been created and its
status is INITIALIZED, you can upload your game build.

Do not use this API action unless you are using your own Amazon Simple Storage
Service (Amazon S3) client and need to manually upload your build files.
Instead, to create a build, use the CLI command upload-build, which creates a
new build record and uploads the build files in one step. (See the Amazon
GameLift Developer Guide
[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-build-intro.html] 
help on packaging and uploading your build.) 

To create a new build, identify the operating system of the game server
binaries. All game servers in a build must use the same operating system.
Optionally, specify a build name and version; this metadata is stored with other
properties in the build record and is displayed in the GameLift console (it is
not visible to players). If successful, this action returns the newly created
build record along with the Amazon S3 storage location and AWS account
credentials. Use the location and credentials to upload your game build.

    /**
     * Creates a new fleet to run your game servers. A fleet is a set of Amazon Elastic
Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, each of which can run multiple server
processes to host game sessions. You configure a fleet to create instances with
certain hardware specifications (see Amazon EC2 Instance Types
[https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/] for more information), and deploy a
specified game build to each instance. A newly created fleet passes through
several statuses; once it reaches the ACTIVE status, it can begin hosting game
sessions.

To create a new fleet, provide a fleet name, an EC2 instance type, and a build
ID of the game build to deploy. You can also configure the new fleet with the
following settings: (1) a runtime configuration describing what server processes
to run on each instance in the fleet (required to create fleet), (2) access
permissions for inbound traffic, (3) fleet-wide game session protection, and (4)
the location of default log files for GameLift to upload and store.

If the CreateFleet call is successful, Amazon GameLift performs the following
tasks:

 &amp;#42; Creates a fleet record and sets the status to NEW (followed by other statuses
   as the fleet is activated).
 &amp;#42; Sets the fleet&#x27;s capacity to 1 &quot;desired&quot;, which causes GameLift to start one
   new EC2 instance.
 &amp;#42; Starts launching server processes on the instance. If the fleet is configured
   to run multiple server processes per instance, GameLift staggers each launch
   by a few seconds.
 &amp;#42; Begins writing events to the fleet event log, which can be accessed in the
   GameLift console.
 &amp;#42; Sets the fleet&#x27;s status to ACTIVE once one server process in the fleet is
   ready to host a game session.

After a fleet is created, use the following actions to change fleet properties
and configuration:

 &amp;#42;  UpdateFleetAttributes -- Update fleet metadata, including name and
   description.
 &amp;#42;  UpdateFleetCapacity -- Increase or decrease the number of instances you want
   the fleet to maintain.
 &amp;#42;  UpdateFleetPortSettings -- Change the IP address and port ranges that allow
   access to incoming traffic.
 &amp;#42;  UpdateRuntimeConfiguration -- Change how server processes are launched in
   the fleet, including launch path, launch parameters, and the number of
   concurrent processes.

session record and assigns the new session to an instance in the specified
fleet, which initializes a new server process to host the game session. A fleet
must be in an ACTIVE status before a game session can be created in it.

To create a game session, specify either a fleet ID or an alias ID and indicate
the maximum number of players the game session allows. You can also provide a
name and a set of properties for your game (optional). If successful, a 
GameSession object is returned containing session properties, including an IP
address. By default, newly created game sessions are set to accept adding any
new players to the game session. Use UpdateGameSession to change the creation

prompts Amazon GameLift to track a certain metric for a fleet and automatically

simultaneously.

A scaling policy rule statement has the following structure:

minutes, then [ScalingAdjustmentType] to/by [ScalingAdjustment].

For example, this policy: &quot;If the number of idle instances exceeds 20 for more
than 15 minutes, then reduce the fleet capacity by 10 instances&quot; could be
implemented as the following rule statement: 

If [IdleInstances] is [GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold] [20] for [15] minutes,
then [ChangeInCapacity] by [-10].

     * Retrieves a list of game sessions in a fleet that match a set of search criteria
and sorts them in a specified order. Currently game session searches are limited
to a single fleet. Search results include only game sessions that are in ACTIVE

 &amp;#42;  gameSessionId -- ID value assigned to a game session. This unique value is
   returned in a GameSession object when a new game session is created. 
 &amp;#42;  gameSessionName -- Name assigned to a game session. This value is set when
   requesting a new game session with CreateGameSession or updating with 
   UpdateGameSession. Game session names do not need to be unique to a game
   session.
 &amp;#42;  creationTimeMillis -- Value indicating when a game session was created. It
   is expressed in Unix time as milliseconds.
 &amp;#42;  playerSessionCount -- Number of players currently connected to a game
   session. This value changes rapidly as players join the session or drop out.
 &amp;#42;  maximumSessions -- Maximum number of player sessions allowed for a game
   session. This value is set when requesting a new game session with 
   CreateGameSession or updating with UpdateGameSession.
 &amp;#42;  hasAvailablePlayerSessions -- Boolean value indicating whether or not a game
   session has reached its maximum number of players. When searching with this
   attribute, the search value must be true or false. It is highly recommended
   that all search requests include this filter attribute to optimize search
   performance and return only sessions that players can join. 

To search or sort, specify either a fleet ID or an alias ID, and provide a
search filter expression, a sort expression, or both. Use the pagination
parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequential pages. If successful, a
collection of GameSession objects matching the request is returned.

Returned values for playerSessionCount and hasAvailablePlayerSessions change
quickly as players join sessions and others drop out. Results should be
considered a snapshot in time. Be sure to refresh search results often, and
handle sessions that fill up before a player can join.

     * Updates capacity settings for a fleet. Use this action to specify the number of
EC2 instances (hosts) that you want this fleet to contain. Before calling this
action, you may want to call DescribeEC2InstanceLimits to get the maximum
capacity based on the fleet&#x27;s EC2 instance type.

If you&#x27;re using autoscaling (see PutScalingPolicy), you may want to specify a
minimum and/or maximum capacity. If you don&#x27;t provide these, autoscaling can set
capacity anywhere between zero and the service limits
[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html#limits_gamelift]
.

To update fleet capacity, specify the fleet ID and the number of instances you
want the fleet to host. If successful, Amazon GameLift starts or terminates
instances so that the fleet&#x27;s active instance count matches the desired instance
count. You can view a fleet&#x27;s current capacity information by calling 
DescribeFleetCapacity. If the desired instance count is higher than the instance
type&#x27;s limit, the &quot;Limit Exceeded&quot; exception occurs.

it does not need to be in an ACTIVE status.

To update runtime configuration, specify the fleet ID and provide a 
RuntimeConfiguration object with the updated collection of server process
configurations.

Each instance in a GameLift fleet checks regularly for an updated runtime
configuration and changes how it launches server processes to comply with the
latest version. Existing server processes are not affected by the update; they
continue to run until they end, while GameLift simply adds new server processes
to fit the current runtime configuration. As a result, the runtime configuration
changes are applied gradually as existing processes shut down and new processes
are launched in GameLift&#x27;s normal process recycling activity.
