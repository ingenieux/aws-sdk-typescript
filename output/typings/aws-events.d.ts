    * Amazon CloudWatch Events helps you to respond to state changes in your AWS
 resources. When your resources change state they automatically send events into
 an event stream. You can create rules that match selected events in the stream
 and route them to targets to take action. You can also use rules to take action
 on a pre-determined schedule. For example, you can configure rules to: 
 
  &amp;#42; Automatically invoke an AWS Lambda function to update DNS entries when an
    event notifies you that Amazon EC2 instance enters the running state.
  &amp;#42; Direct specific API records from CloudTrail to an Amazon Kinesis stream for
    detailed analysis of potential security or availability risks.
  &amp;#42; Periodically invoke a built-in target to create a snapshot of an Amazon EBS
    volume.
 
  For more information about Amazon CloudWatch Events features, see the Amazon
 CloudWatch Developer Guide
 [http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide].

 Note: When you create or update a rule, incoming events might not immediately

A rule must contain at least an EventPattern or ScheduleExpression. Rules with
EventPatterns are triggered when a matching event is observed. Rules with
ScheduleExpressions self-trigger based on the given schedule. A rule can have
both an EventPattern and a ScheduleExpression, in which case the rule will
trigger on matching events as well as on a schedule.

 Note: Most services in AWS treat : or / as the same character in Amazon
Resource Names (ARNs). However, CloudWatch Events uses an exact match in event
patterns and rules. Be sure to use the correct ARN characters when creating
event patterns so that they match the ARN syntax in the event you want to match.

    /**
     * Adds target(s) to a rule. Targets are the resources that can be invoked when a
rule is triggered. For example, AWS Lambda functions, Amazon Kinesis streams,
and built-in targets. Updates the target(s) if they are already associated with
the role. In other words, if there is already a target with the given target ID,
then the target associated with that ID is updated.

In order to be able to make API calls against the resources you own, Amazon
CloudWatch Events needs the appropriate permissions. For AWS Lambda and Amazon
SNS resources, CloudWatch Events relies on resource-based policies. For Amazon
Kinesis streams, CloudWatch Events relies on IAM roles. For more information,
see Permissions for Sending Events to Targets
[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/EventsTargetPermissions.html] 
in the Amazon CloudWatch Developer Guide.

Input and InputPath are mutually-exclusive and optional parameters of a target.
When a rule is triggered due to a matched event, if for a target:

 &amp;#42; Neither Input nor InputPath is specified, then the entire event is passed to
   the target in JSON form.
 &amp;#42;  InputPath is specified in the form of JSONPath (e.g. $.detail), then only
   the part of the event specified in the path is passed to the target (e.g.
   only the detail part of the event is passed). 
 &amp;#42;  Input is specified in the form of a valid JSON, then the matched event is
   overridden with this constant.

 Note: When you add targets to a rule, when the associated rule triggers, new or
updated targets might not be immediately invoked. Please allow a short period of
time for changes to take effect.
