    * Amazon CloudWatch monitors your Amazon Web Services (AWS) resources and the
 applications you run on AWS in real-time. You can use CloudWatch to collect and
 track metrics, which are the variables you want to measure for your resources
 and applications.
 
 CloudWatch alarms send notifications or automatically make changes to the
 resources you are monitoring based on rules that you define. For example, you
 can monitor the CPU usage and disk reads and writes of your Amazon Elastic
 Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances and then use this data to determine whether
 you should launch additional instances to handle increased load. You can also
 use this data to stop under-used instances to save money.
 
 In addition to monitoring the built-in metrics that come with AWS, you can
 monitor your own custom metrics. With CloudWatch, you gain system-wide
 visibility into resource utilization, application performance, and operational
 health.

     * Gets statistics for the specified metric.

 The maximum number of data points that can be queried is 50,850, whereas the
maximum number of data points returned from a single GetMetricStatistics request
is 1,440. If you make a request that generates more than 1,440 data points,
Amazon CloudWatch returns an error. In such a case, you can alter the request by
narrowing the specified time range or increasing the specified period. A period
can be as short as one minute (60 seconds) or as long as one day (86,400
seconds). Alternatively, you can make multiple requests across adjacent time
ranges. GetMetricStatistics does not return the data in chronological order. 

 Amazon CloudWatch aggregates data points based on the length of the period that
you specify. For example, if you request statistics with a one-minute
granularity, Amazon CloudWatch aggregates data points with time stamps that fall
within the same one-minute period. In such a case, the data points queried can
greatly outnumber the data points returned. 

 The following examples show various statistics allowed by the data point query
maximum of 50,850 when you call GetMetricStatistics on Amazon EC2 instances with
detailed (one-minute) monitoring enabled: 

 &amp;#42;  Statistics for up to 400 instances for a span of one hour
   
   
 &amp;#42;  Statistics for up to 35 instances over a span of 24 hours
   
   
 &amp;#42;  Statistics for up to 2 instances over a span of 2 weeks

    /**
     * Creates or updates an alarm and associates it with the specified Amazon
CloudWatch metric. Optionally, this operation can associate one or more Amazon
SNS resources with the alarm.

 When this operation creates an alarm, the alarm state is immediately set to 
INSUFFICIENT_DATA. The alarm is evaluated and its StateValue is set
appropriately. Any actions associated with the StateValue are then executed. 

When updating an existing alarm, its StateValue is left unchanged, but it
completely overwrites the alarm&#x27;s previous configuration.

If you are using an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) account to create
or modify an alarm, you must have the following Amazon EC2 permissions:

 &amp;#42;   ec2:DescribeInstanceStatus and ec2:DescribeInstances for all alarms on
   Amazon EC2 instance status metrics.
   
   
 &amp;#42;   ec2:StopInstances for alarms with stop actions.
   
   
 &amp;#42;   ec2:TerminateInstances for alarms with terminate actions.
   
   
 &amp;#42;   ec2:DescribeInstanceRecoveryAttribute, and ec2:RecoverInstances for alarms
   with recover actions.
   
   

If you have read/write permissions for Amazon CloudWatch but not for Amazon EC2,
you can still create an alarm but the stop or terminate actions won&#x27;t be
performed on the Amazon EC2 instance. However, if you are later granted
permission to use the associated Amazon EC2 APIs, the alarm actions you created
earlier will be performed. For more information about IAM permissions, see 
Permissions and Policies
[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/PermissionsAndPolicies.html] in 
Using IAM.

If you are using an IAM role (e.g., an Amazon EC2 instance profile), you cannot
stop or terminate the instance using alarm actions. However, you can still see
the alarm state and perform any other actions such as Amazon SNS notifications
or Auto Scaling policies.

If you are using temporary security credentials granted using the AWS Security
Token Service (AWS STS), you cannot stop or terminate an Amazon EC2 instance
using alarm actions.

ListMetrics. 

 Each PutMetricData request is limited to 8 KB in size for HTTP GET requests and
is limited to 40 KB in size for HTTP POST requests. 

Although the Value parameter accepts numbers of type Double, Amazon CloudWatch
