see RFC 2132 [http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2132.txt].

 &amp;#42;   domain-name-servers - The IP addresses of up to four domain name servers, or
   AmazonProvidedDNS. The default DHCP option set specifies AmazonProvidedDNS.
   If specifying more than one domain name server, specify the IP addresses in a
   single parameter, separated by commas. If you want your instance to receive a
   custom DNS hostname as specified in domain-name, you must set 
   domain-name-servers to a custom DNS server.
   
   
 &amp;#42;   domain-name - If you&#x27;re using AmazonProvidedDNS in &quot;us-east-1&quot;, specify
   &quot;ec2.internal&quot;. If you&#x27;re using AmazonProvidedDNS in another region, specify
   &quot;region.compute.internal&quot; (for example, &quot;ap-northeast-1.compute.internal&quot;).
   Otherwise, specify a domain name (for example, &quot;MyCompany.com&quot;). This value
   is used to complete unqualified DNS hostnames. Important: Some Linux
   operating systems accept multiple domain names separated by spaces. However,
   Windows and other Linux operating systems treat the value as a single domain,
   which results in unexpected behavior. If your DHCP options set is associated
   with a VPC that has instances with multiple operating systems, specify only
   one domain name.
   
   
 &amp;#42;   ntp-servers - The IP addresses of up to four Network Time Protocol (NTP)
   servers.
   
   
 &amp;#42;   netbios-name-servers - The IP addresses of up to four NetBIOS name servers.
   
   
 &amp;#42;   netbios-node-type - The NetBIOS node type (1, 2, 4, or 8). We recommend that
   you specify 2 (broadcast and multicast are not currently supported). For more
   information about these node types, see RFC 2132

When a snapshot is created, any AWS Marketplace product codes that are

You can take a snapshot of an attached volume that is in use. However, snapshots
only capture data that has been written to your EBS volume at the time the
snapshot command is issued; this may exclude any data that has been cached by
any applications or the operating system. If you can pause any file systems on
the volume long enough to take a snapshot, your snapshot should be complete.
However, if you cannot pause all file writes to the volume, you should unmount
the volume from within the instance, issue the snapshot command, and then
remount the volume to ensure a consistent and complete snapshot. You may remount
and use your volume while the snapshot status is pending.

To create a snapshot for EBS volumes that serve as root devices, you should stop
the instance before taking the snapshot.

Snapshots that are taken from encrypted volumes are automatically encrypted.
Volumes that are created from encrypted snapshots are also automatically

     * Creates a subnet in an existing VPC.

When you create each subnet, you provide the VPC ID and the CIDR block you want

subnet&#x27;s CIDR block can be the same as the VPC&#x27;s CIDR block (assuming you want
only a single subnet in the VPC), or a subset of the VPC&#x27;s CIDR block. If you
create more than one subnet in a VPC, the subnets&#x27; CIDR blocks must not overlap.
The smallest subnet (and VPC) you can create uses a /28 netmask (16 IP
addresses), and the largest uses a /16 netmask (65,536 IP addresses).

AWS reserves both the first four and the last IP address in each subnet&#x27;s CIDR
block. They&#x27;re not available for use.

If you add more than one subnet to a VPC, they&#x27;re set up in a star topology with
a logical router in the middle.

If you launch an instance in a VPC using an Amazon EBS-backed AMI, the IP
address doesn&#x27;t change if you stop and restart the instance (unlike a similar
instance launched outside a VPC, which gets a new IP address when restarted).
It&#x27;s therefore possible to have a subnet with no running instances (they&#x27;re all
stopped), but no remaining IP addresses available.

     * Describes the status of the specified volumes. Volume status provides the result
of the checks performed on your volumes to determine events that can impair the
performance of your volumes. The performance of a volume can be affected if an
issue occurs on the volume&#x27;s underlying host. If the volume&#x27;s underlying host
experiences a power outage or system issue, after the system is restored, there
could be data inconsistencies on the volume. Volume events notify you if this
occurs. Volume actions notify you if any action needs to be taken in response to
the event.

The DescribeVolumeStatus operation provides the following information about the
specified volumes:

 Status: Reflects the current status of the volume. The possible values are ok, 
impaired , warning, or insufficient-data. If all checks pass, the overall status
of the volume is ok. If the check fails, the overall status is impaired. If the
status is insufficient-data, then the checks may still be taking place on your
volume at the time. We recommend that you retry the request. For more
information on volume status, see Monitoring the Status of Your Volumes
[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring-volume-status.html]
.

 Events: Reflect the cause of a volume status and may require you to take
action. For example, if your volume returns an impaired status, then the volume
event might be potential-data-inconsistency. This means that your volume has
been affected by an issue with the underlying host, has all I/O operations
disabled, and may have inconsistent data.

 Actions: Reflect the actions you may have to take in response to an event. For
example, if the status of the volume is impaired and the volume event shows 
potential-data-inconsistency, then the action shows enable-volume-io. This means
that you may want to enable the I/O operations for the volume by calling the 
EnableVolumeIO action and then check the volume for data consistency.

Volume status is based on the volume status checks, and does not reflect the
volume state. Therefore, volume status does not indicate volumes in the error 
state (for example, when a volume is incapable of accepting I/O.)

[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/creating-an-ami.html] in the 
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.

For Amazon EBS-backed instances, CreateImage creates and registers the AMI in a
single request, so you don&#x27;t have to register the AMI yourself.

You can also use RegisterImage to create an Amazon EBS-backed Linux AMI from a
snapshot of a root device volume. For more information, see Launching an
Instance from a Snapshot
[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_LaunchingInstanceFromSnapshot.html] 
in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.

Some Linux distributions, such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and SUSE Linux
Enterprise Server (SLES), use the EC2 billingProduct code associated with an AMI
to verify subscription status for package updates. Creating an AMI from an EBS
snapshot does not maintain this billing code, and subsequent instances launched
from such an AMI will not be able to connect to package update infrastructure.

Similarly, although you can create a Windows AMI from a snapshot, you can&#x27;t
successfully launch an instance from the AMI.

To create Windows AMIs or to create AMIs for Linux operating systems that must
retain AMI billing codes to work properly, see CreateImage.

If needed, you can deregister an AMI at any time. Any modifications you make to
an AMI backed by an instance store volume invalidates its registration. If you
make changes to an image, deregister the previous image and register the new
image.

You can&#x27;t register an image where a secondary (non-root) snapshot has AWS
Marketplace product codes.

charged for Amazon EBS volume usage. You can restart your instance at any time.
Each time you transition an instance from stopped to started, Amazon EC2 charges
a full instance hour, even if transitions happen multiple times within a single
hour.

Before stopping an instance, make sure it is in a state from which it can be
restarted. Stopping an instance does not preserve data stored in RAM.

Performing this operation on an instance that uses an instance store as its root
device returns an error.

     * Stops an Amazon EBS-backed instance.

We don&#x27;t charge hourly usage for a stopped instance, or data transfer fees;
however, your root partition Amazon EBS volume remains, continues to persist
your data, and you are charged for Amazon EBS volume usage. Each time you
transition an instance from stopped to started, Amazon EC2 charges a full
instance hour, even if transitions happen multiple times within a single hour.

You can&#x27;t start or stop Spot instances, and you can&#x27;t stop instance store-backed
instances.

When you stop an instance, we shut it down. You can restart your instance at any
time. Before stopping an instance, make sure it is in a state from which it can
be restarted. Stopping an instance does not preserve data stored in RAM.

Stopping an instance is different to rebooting or terminating it. For example,
when you stop an instance, the root device and any other devices attached to the
instance persist. When you terminate an instance, the root device and any other
devices attached during the instance launch are automatically deleted. For more
information about the differences between rebooting, stopping, and terminating
instances, see Instance Lifecycle
[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-lifecycle.html] 
in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.

When you stop an instance, we attempt to shut it down forcibly after a short
while. If your instance appears stuck in the stopping state after a period of
time, there may be an issue with the underlying host computer. For more
information, see Troubleshooting Stopping Your Instance
[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/TroubleshootingInstancesStopping.html]

    /**
     * Shuts down one or more instances. This operation is idempotent; if you terminate
an instance more than once, each call succeeds.

Terminated instances remain visible after termination (for approximately one
hour).

By default, Amazon EC2 deletes all EBS volumes that were attached when the
instance launched. Volumes attached after instance launch continue running.

You can stop, start, and terminate EBS-backed instances. You can only terminate
instance store-backed instances. What happens to an instance differs if you stop
it or terminate it. For example, when you stop an instance, the root device and
any other devices attached to the instance persist. When you terminate an
instance, any attached EBS volumes with the DeleteOnTermination block device
mapping parameter set to true are automatically deleted. For more information
