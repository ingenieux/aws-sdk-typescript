    * Welcome to the Amazon Simple Queue Service API Reference. This section describes
 who should read this guide, how the guide is organized, and other resources
 related to the Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS).
 
 Amazon SQS offers reliable and scalable hosted queues for storing messages as
 they travel between computers. By using Amazon SQS, you can move data between
 distributed components of your applications that perform different tasks without
 losing messages or requiring each component to be always available.

    /**
     * Adds a permission to a queue for a specific principal
[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/glos-chap.html#P]. This allows for
sharing access to the queue.

When you create a queue, you have full control access rights for the queue. Only
you (as owner of the queue) can grant or deny permissions to the queue. For more
information about these permissions, see Shared Queues
[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/acp-overview.html] 
in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide.

AddPermission writes an Amazon SQS-generated policy. If you want to write your
own policy, use SetQueueAttributes to upload your policy. For more information
about writing your own policy, see Using The Access Policy Language
[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/AccessPolicyLanguage.html] 
in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide.

Some API actions take lists of parameters. These lists are specified using the 
param.n notation. Values of n are integers starting from 1. For example, a
parameter list with two elements looks like this:
     *
     * @error OverLimit   
     */
    addPermission(params: SQS.AddPermissionRequest, callback?: (err: SQS.OverLimit | any, data: any) => void): Request<any, SQS.OverLimit | any>;
    /**
     * Changes the visibility timeout of a specified message in a queue to a new value.
The maximum allowed timeout value you can set the value to is 12 hours. This
means you can&#x27;t extend the timeout of a message in an existing queue to more
than a total visibility timeout of 12 hours. (For more information visibility
timeout, see Visibility Timeout
[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/AboutVT.html] 
in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide.)

For example, let&#x27;s say you have a message and its default message visibility
timeout is 5 minutes. After 3 minutes, you call ChangeMessageVisiblity with a
timeout of 10 minutes. At that time, the timeout for the message would be
extended by 10 minutes beyond the time of the ChangeMessageVisibility call. This
results in a total visibility timeout of 13 minutes. You can continue to call
ChangeMessageVisibility to extend the visibility timeout to a maximum of 12
hours. If you try to extend beyond 12 hours, the request will be rejected.

There is a 120,000 limit for the number of inflight messages per queue. Messages
are inflight after they have been received from the queue by a consuming
component, but have not yet been deleted from the queue. If you reach the
120,000 limit, you will receive an OverLimit error message from Amazon SQS. To
help avoid reaching the limit, you should delete the messages from the queue
after they have been processed. You can also increase the number of queues you
use to process the messages. 

If you attempt to set the VisibilityTimeout to an amount more than the maximum
time left, Amazon SQS returns an error. It will not automatically recalculate
and increase the timeout to the maximum time remaining.

Unlike with a queue, when you change the visibility timeout for a specific
message, that timeout value is applied immediately but is not saved in memory
for that message. If you don&#x27;t delete a message after it is received, the
visibility timeout for the message the next time it is received reverts to the
original timeout value, not the value you set with the ChangeMessageVisibility 
action.
     *
     * @error MessageNotInflight   
     * @error ReceiptHandleIsInvalid

ChangeMessageVisibility. The result of the action on each message is reported

requests with each ChangeMessageVisibilityBatch action.

Because the batch request can result in a combination of successful and
unsuccessful actions, you should check for batch errors even when the call
returns an HTTP status code of 200.

Some API actions take lists of parameters. These lists are specified using the 
param.n notation. Values of n are integers starting from 1. For example, a
parameter list with two elements looks like this:

    /**
     * Creates a new queue, or returns the URL of an existing one. When you request 
CreateQueue, you provide a name for the queue. To successfully create a new
queue, you must provide a name that is unique within the scope of your own
queues.

If you delete a queue, you must wait at least 60 seconds before creating a queue
with the same name.

You may pass one or more attributes in the request. If you do not provide a
value for any attribute, the queue will have the default value for that
attribute.

Use GetQueueUrl to get a queue&#x27;s URL. GetQueueUrl requires only the QueueName 
parameter.

If you provide the name of an existing queue, along with the exact names and
values of all the queue&#x27;s attributes, CreateQueue returns the queue URL for the
existing queue. If the queue name, attribute names, or attribute values do not
match an existing queue, CreateQueue returns an error.

Some API actions take lists of parameters. These lists are specified using the 
param.n notation. Values of n are integers starting from 1. For example, a
parameter list with two elements looks like this:
     *
     * @error QueueDeletedRecently   
     * @error QueueNameExists   
     */

    /**
     * Deletes the specified message from the specified queue. You specify the message
by using the message&#x27;s receipt handle and not the message ID you received when
you sent the message. Even if the message is locked by another reader due to the
visibility timeout setting, it is still deleted from the queue. If you leave a
message in the queue for longer than the queue&#x27;s configured retention period,
Amazon SQS automatically deletes it. 

 The receipt handle is associated with a specific instance of receiving the
message. If you receive a message more than once, the receipt handle you get
each time you receive the message is different. When you request DeleteMessage,
if you don&#x27;t provide the most recently received receipt handle for the message,
the request will still succeed, but the message might not be deleted. 

 It is possible you will receive a message even after you have deleted it. This
might happen on rare occasions if one of the servers storing a copy of the
message is unavailable when you request to delete the message. The copy remains
on the server and might be returned to you again on a subsequent receive
request. You should create your system to be idempotent so that receiving a
particular message more than once is not a problem.

    /**
     * Deletes the queue specified by the queue URL, regardless of whether the queue
is empty. If the specified queue does not exist, Amazon SQS returns a successful
response. 

 Use DeleteQueue with care; once you delete your queue, any messages in the
queue are no longer available. 

 When you delete a queue, the deletion process takes up to 60 seconds. Requests
you send involving that queue during the 60 seconds might succeed. For example,
a SendMessage request might succeed, but after the 60 seconds, the queue and
that message you sent no longer exist. Also, when you delete a queue, you must
wait at least 60 seconds before creating a queue with the same name. 

 We reserve the right to delete queues that have had no activity for more than
30 days. For more information, see How Amazon SQS Queues Work

parameter. For more information, see Amazon SQS Long Poll
[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-long-polling.html] 
in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide. 

 Short poll is the default behavior where a weighted random set of machines is
sampled on a ReceiveMessage call. This means only the messages on the sampled
machines are returned. If the number of messages in the queue is small (less
than 1000), it is likely you will get fewer messages than you requested per 
ReceiveMessage call. If the number of messages in the queue is extremely small,
you might not receive any messages in a particular ReceiveMessage response; in
which case you should repeat the request. 

 For each message returned, the response includes the following: 

 &amp;#42;   Message body 
   
   
 &amp;#42;   MD5 digest of the message body. For information about MD5, go to 
   http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1321.html [http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1321.html]
   . 
   
   
 &amp;#42;   Message ID you received when you sent the message to the queue. 
   
   
 &amp;#42;   Receipt handle. 
   
   
 &amp;#42;   Message attributes. 
   
   
 &amp;#42;   MD5 digest of the message attributes. 
   
   

 The receipt handle is the identifier you must provide when deleting the
message. For more information, see Queue and Message Identifiers
[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/ImportantIdentifiers.html] 
in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide. 

 You can provide the VisibilityTimeout parameter in your request, which will be
applied to the messages that Amazon SQS returns in the response. If you do not
include the parameter, the overall visibility timeout for the queue is used for
the returned messages. For more information, see Visibility Timeout
[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/AboutVT.html]
